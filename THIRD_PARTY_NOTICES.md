# Third-party notices

Materialize 3D is MIT licensed (see `LICENSE`). It ships the third-party material below, each under its own license. The app bundle carries this file and `LICENSE` in `Contents/Resources`.

## Fonts

The app interface uses Inter, Instrument Serif, and JetBrains Mono. All three are licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1, reproduced once at the end of this file. Each family's own license file sits next to its font files.

| Font | Files | Copyright |
|---|---|---|
| Inter | `src/assets/fonts/Inter-Latin-Variable.woff2` | Copyright 2016 The Inter Project Authors (https://github.com/rsms/inter) |
| Instrument Serif | `src/assets/fonts/InstrumentSerif-Italic.ttf` | Copyright 2022 The Instrument Serif Project Authors (https://github.com/Instrument/instrument-serif) |
| JetBrains Mono | `src/assets/fonts/JetBrainsMono-*.ttf` | Copyright 2020 The JetBrains Mono Project Authors (https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono) |

## Icons

The sidebar icons in `src/assets/icons/` are by Streamline (https://www.streamlinehq.com), licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). They were changed from two-tone to outline only, drawn in the current text color.

| Icon | File |
|---|---|
| Layout left | `src/assets/icons/layout-left.svg` |
| Loading half | `src/assets/icons/loading-half.svg` |
| Layers stacked | `src/assets/icons/layers-stacked.svg` |
| Rating star | `src/assets/icons/rating-star.svg` |
| Module three | `src/assets/icons/module-three.svg` |

The Attach icon, `src/assets/icons/attach.svg`, is Streamline's Form Edition Image Attach icon from its Freehand Color set, under the same CC BY 4.0 license. Its black parts were changed to draw in the current text color, so it shows in dark mode. Its blue stays as Streamline drew it.

The run trace icons in `src/assets/icons/` are by Lucide (https://lucide.dev), from lucide-static 1.70.0, under the ISC License. The terminal icon comes from Feather by Cole Bemis, under the MIT License. Both licenses are reproduced at the end of this file. The files are as Lucide ships them.

| Icon | File |
|---|---|
| File text | `src/assets/icons/file-text.svg` |
| File pen line | `src/assets/icons/file-pen-line.svg` |
| Terminal | `src/assets/icons/terminal.svg` |
| Layers | `src/assets/icons/layers.svg` |
| Message square | `src/assets/icons/message-square.svg` |
| Circle check | `src/assets/icons/circle-check.svg` |
| Circle x | `src/assets/icons/circle-x.svg` |

## Model marks

The model picker shows each maker's official mark beside its models. The marks are the makers' trademarks. They are used only to name the maker of a model, not to suggest that the maker endorses Materialize 3D. The SVG paths come from Simple Icons 15.22.0 (https://simpleicons.org, CC0 1.0), which collects each mark from its maker's own site.

| Mark | File | Owner and source |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | `src/assets/icons/claude.svg` | Anthropic, PBC. Taken from https://claude.ai, in its brand color #D97757 |
| OpenAI | `src/assets/icons/openai.svg` | OpenAI. Taken from https://openai.com/brand, drawn in the current text color |

## Bambu Studio

Materialize 3D does not include or redistribute Bambu Studio. It runs a copy that you install from Bambu Lab.

## Software dependencies

The app is built from open source Rust crates and JavaScript packages, each under its own license. `src-tauri/Cargo.lock` and `bun.lock` pin the exact versions.

## SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1

-----------------------------------------------------------
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.
