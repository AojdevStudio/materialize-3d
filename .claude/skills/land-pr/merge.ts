/**
 * The merge decision: may this PR head merge, judged from the review bot's check-runs.
 * Pure, so the gate and tests share it. The gate fetches the state over the REST API.
 *
 * Pullfrog is the active review bot. Its `pullfrog-approval` check-run concluding
 * `success` on the exact head is the pass signal. The gate reads the latest run per check
 * suite, and Pullfrog has one suite per commit, so its reruns collapse to one run. A second
 * run of that name, or a run from another app, means another producer used the name, and
 * no verdict on that commit is trusted. Every merge requires a successful verdict on the
 * exact head, including a merge commit that resolves conflicts.
 *
 * The kit's source repo is the owner's curated settings repo, and no review bot gates it.
 * The owner also exempted two repos with no review bot installed, which take local reviews only
 * (2026-10-27), and six product meta (planning) repos with no review bot installed (2026-10-29). The list lives here in the kit, never in a file the target repo could edit. It holds SHA-256
 * digests of lowercase `owner/name`, so the kit can ship to public repos without naming a
 * private one. The exemption holds only when the merge command names the repo itself,
 * because a repo guessed from the cwd or the environment can differ from the one gh merges.
